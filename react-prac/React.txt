1) let: - 
	Let defines a local variable limiting their scope to the block in which they are declared.
	
2) const :- 
	Const defines a constant variable whose values cannot be changed.

3) var :- 


4) State :- Basically ‘state’ holds synchronous variables. If you change the value of a state variable then 
	    the change is reflected immediately in all the places that particular variable is used.
5) Props :- are just like arguments passed in a function or method. In React props (arguments) are passed into an HTML tag as input arguments.
	    Passing data from one component to another component.
6) React- Router :- Redirect to specific page using react router. 
		    for example, you want to redirect from Home page to blog page  you need to use React router for redirecting the page.
7) Store :- It contains the state of the components which need to be passed to other components. 
	    The store makes this passing along much easier as we no longer need to maintain a state inside a parent component in order 
	    to pass the same to its children components.
8) Action :- The actions part of the react-redux basically contains the different actions that are to be performed on the state present in the store.
	     The actions included must contain the type of the action and can also contain payload(data field in the actions).
9) Reducer :- The reducers in react-redux are the pure functions that contain the operations that need to be performed on the state.
	      These functions accept the initial state of the state being used and the action type.
	      It updates the state and responds with the new state. 
	      This updated state is sent back to the view components of the react to make the necessary changes. 
	      A reducer must contain the action type.
